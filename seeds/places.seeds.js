The former village, which became home to people of modest means, chased out of Paris by Haussman's renovations at the end of the 19th century, has recently seen a complete change. Built in 1988 on top of the Belleville hill, the Belleville park (45,000 m¬≤) offers an unrestricted panoramic view of the capital. A wooded village destined for children offers tower staircases and toboggans in all sizes. There is a water course, made up of waterfalls and streams and a panoramic viewpoint where you can admire the Parisian landscape. Evidence of the area's wine-producing past, the park also has 140 vines, which each produce around 2 to 3 kilos of grapes. Harvesting takes place every year. ",

Set in a 34-hectare ecologically managed park, the 40 ‚Äòhouses‚Äô were built between 1925 and 1969. They reflect a diversity of architectural styles inspired by the Modernist movement and the different countries represented. Five of them are classified as historic monuments, including the Swiss Foundation and the Brazil House, both designed by Le Corbusier. Familiarly known as the ‚ÄòCit√©-U‚Äô, the campus welcomes 12,000 students and researchers from 140 countries each year and offers a vibrant cultural programme of events including shows, exhibitions and guided tours.
